# UI Engineering Assignment – Landing Page Recreation

This project is a **UI-focused implementation** of a landing page based on a provided Figma design. The goal was to **recreate the UI as accurately as possible**, ensure **strong responsiveness across devices**, and extend the design system by adding additional pages — all using **modern frontend best practices**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The assignment focused on three key areas:

### 1️⃣ Exact UI Replication
- Pixel-accurate layout matching the Figma design
- Correct typography, spacing, colors, and hierarchy
- Clean and maintainable UI component structure
- No backend logic — UI engineering only

### 2️⃣ Responsive Design (Critical)
The UI is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop**
- **Tablet**
- **Mobile**

Key responsiveness decisions include:
- Fluid layouts with flexible containers
- Typography scaling for smaller screens
- Spacing and padding adjustments per breakpoint
- Logical section stacking for mobile usability

> Since no mobile design was provided, responsiveness was handled thoughtfully based on UX best practices.

### 3️⃣ Additional Pages (Design Extension)
To demonstrate scalability of the design system, I added **additional pages** while maintaining visual consistency:

- **About Page** – Brand/product overview
- **Contact Page** – Allows you to contact the team 
*(Store, Games, and Connect Wallet sections were intentionally removed as allowed)*
